BANNER = """*** Welcome to the Game of Nim! ***
*Spoiler Alert: I am probably going to win...*
"""

RULES="""Nim is a deceptively simple two-player game where stones mysteriously disappear,
one, two, or three at a time!
The game kicks off with two piles of stones, cleverly named Pile 1 and Pile 2
(because creativity matters!). Players take turns.
On your turn, pick a pile and decide how many stones to make vanish: 1, 2, or 3.
The goal? Be the one to remove the very last stone and victory!
But hey, do not feel bad when you lose...I have had lots of practice!
